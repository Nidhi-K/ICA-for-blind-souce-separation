# ICA-for-blind-souce-separation

### Overview
Given mixed signals which have been created by mixing a finite
number of unknown source signals by an unknown mixing process, the aim
is to recover the original signals using Independent Component Analysis (ICA).

### Data
We use 5 source signals which are ~4s audio clips each of different sounds
(man talking, people clapping, etc.)

### Results
In one experiment, we take 4 source signals and use 8 microphones to get
8 mixed signals:

We recover the signals as shown on the right, and compare them to the original source
signals as shown on the left:
